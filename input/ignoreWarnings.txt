# Editorial comment: External FHIR extension link resolution issue
# The targetElement extension is from the HL7 FHIR extensions package but the link cannot be resolved during IG build
# This is a known issue with external extension documentation links and does not affect functionality
# The extension itself works correctly - only the documentation link is unresolvable
The link 'StructureDefinition-targetElement.html' for "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/targetElement" cannot be resolved

# Add warning and/or information messages here after you've confirmed that they aren't really a problem
# (And include comments like this justifying why)
# See https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig/blob/master/input/ignoreWarnings.txt for examples

Published code systems SHOULD conform to the ShareableCodeSystem profile, which says that the element CodeSystem.caseSensitive is mandatory, but it is not present

# External Australian terminology server dependency - endpoint connection type CodeSystem
# This CodeSystem is hosted on the AU terminology server which may not be available to all validators
# The code validation failure is due to server connectivity, not IG content issues
A definition for CodeSystem 'http://terminology.hl7.org.au/CodeSystem/endpoint-connection-type' could not be found, so the code cannot be validated

# Example endpoint URL - not a vocabulary URI that can be "defined"

There are multiple different potential matches for the url 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-PurposeOfUse'. It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '3.1.0', found versions: 3.0.0, 3.1.0. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-PurposeOfUse' to 'http://terminology.hl7.org/ValueSet/v3-PurposeOfUse|3.1.0'

# Editorial comment: FHIR Tools StructureDefinition resolution issue
# The expansion-parameters StructureDefinition is from the FHIR tools package and may not be available on all servers, This is used for ValueSet expansion operations and does not affect the core functionality of profiles, Suppressing this error as it's a server-side dependency issue, not a profile validation problem

# Editorial comment: NOI identifier not currently recognised for HSP-O
# Editor's Comment: The au-core-org-01 constraint currently only recognizes HPI-O and PAI-O as valid NOI identifiers, HSP-O support will be added to au-core in a future release. This validation error is expected and does not affect the core functionality of the HSP-O identifier profile.
Constraint failed: au-core-org-01: 'A National Organisation Identifier (type=NOI) shall be an HPI-O or PAI-O (type.coding.where(code='NOI').exists() implies ((system='http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/hi/hpio/1.0') or (system='http://ns.electronichealth.net.au/id/pcehr/paio/1.0')))' (defined in http://hl7.org.au/fhir/core/StructureDefinition/au-core-organization|2.0.0-ballot)
