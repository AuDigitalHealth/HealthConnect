Health Connect Provider Directory is a searchable online database that stores healthcare provider information. When you need to find a doctor, clinic, or healthcare service, you can search by location, medical specialty, or availability, and the system returns detailed information including practitioner registration numbers, healthcare organisation details, physical addresses and contact information, and available services with booking details. This Implementation Guide provides the technical instructions for software developers to connect their healthcare systems to this centralised provider directory. Instead of manually calling offices or looking up provider details individually, healthcare software can automatically retrieve verified, up-to-date provider information from the national database. This eliminates duplicate data entry, reduces verification phone calls, and enables automated referral processes across Australia's healthcare system, making it easier for patients to access the right care at the right time.
