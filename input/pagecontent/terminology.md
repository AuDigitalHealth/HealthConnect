The [value sets](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset.html) and [code systems](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/codesystem.html) listed below are defined as part of this implementation guide.

**Note:** This IG consumes terminology from external dependencies where appropriate and also defines a set of IG-local terminology. The sections below list the external terminology this IG references (split by source) and the terminology defined within this IG.

### External Terminology
