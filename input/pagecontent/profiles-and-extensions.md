### Profiles

The following profiles and have been defined for this implementation guide.

<!-- ================================================ -->
<!--  use this line to include an autogenerated list of all profiles and highlight new ones using the input/data/new_stuff.yml list.  Remove it if you would like to hand generate it -->

{% include sd-list-generator.md %}

### Extensions

The below extensions which have **NOT** been prefixed with HC, will be abstracted to a Common Components FHIR IG. This IG will host common extensions used across Agency FHIR Implementation guides. 

Because of this re-structure, implementers should note the difference in uri namespaces that result. This change has been made early, to prevent later breaking changes. Later releases of this HCPD IG will declare the Common Components IG as a dependency and the extension itself will reside there.
